## Commits

On commits, we are following the **Conventional Commits**, you can see the documentation on the link below.

<ExternalLinkButton
  className={"mt-4 inline-block"}
  href={URLs.conventionalCommits}
>
  <span>Conventional Commits</span>
</ExternalLinkButton>

But basically the **Conventional Commits** set some rules to use when you write your commits messages, see some examples below:

- **New feature:** `feat: <your-message>`;
- **Fixing a bug:** `fix: <your-message>`;
- **Refactoring a piece of code:** `refactor: <your-message>`;
- **Working on documentation:** `docs: <your-message>`.
